# Mercari Price Recommendation Model
Mercari, Japan’s biggest community-powered shopping app, knows this problem deeply. They’d like to offer pricing suggestions to sellers, but this is tough because their sellers are enabled to put just about anything, or any bundle of things, on Mercari's marketplace.

In this competition, the objective is to build an algorithm that automatically suggests the right product prices. We are provided with user-inputted text descriptions of their products, including details like product category name, brand name, and item condition.
